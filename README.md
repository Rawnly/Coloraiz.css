# Coloraiz.css
This framework is ready to use without learning sass/scss, it's compiled in a single .css file with a class for every color shade. In this guide you'll learn how to implement in your projects, so.. let's start coding!

<h2>Available colors:</h2> 
- Blue
- Purple
- Light Red
- Orange
- Green
- Marine
- Azure
- Light Gray
- Gray (includes White & Black)

<h2>Why Colorize?</h2>
What Coloraiz wants to do is semplify the color selection, so we added 13 shades for every colors. Shades are structured with numbers, ranging from 1 to 13 (from lighter to darker) 

Here the list with sample classes: 
```html
.cz-$colorname-1
.cz-$colorname-2
.cz-$colorname-3
.cz-$colorname-4
.cz-$colorname-5
.cz-$colorname-6
.cz-$colorname-7
.cz-$colorname-8
.cz-$colorname-9
.cz-$colorname-10
.cz-$colorname-11
.cz-$colorname-12
.cz-$colorname-13
```

So as you can see there is a prefix before every $colorname and next there is the number of the shade.
